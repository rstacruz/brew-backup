# brew-backup
Backs up your [Homebrew] profile.

```sh
brew-backup
```

Creates the following files:

- `brew.sh` â€” List of [Homebrew] packages
- `cask.sh` - List of cask packages, if [Cask] is installed
- `index` - List of versions

On a different machine, you can run `brew.sh` and `cask.sh` to reinstall the same packages.

Optional, but recommended: commit these files into a Git repo and share them to the world!

[Homebrew]: http://brew.sh/
[Cask]: http://caskroom.io/
